Carly, a process engineer has identified two potential causes for electric motor vibrations, the material used for the motor casing and the supply source of bearings used in the motor.  She conducted an experiment in which motors with casings made of steel, aluminum, and plastic were constructed using bearings supplied by their five suppliers.  The motors were run and a measure of the vibration was recorded.  Conduct the appropriate analysis to determine if either the material or the supplier is a source of vibration, allowing for the possibility of interaction between the material and supplier.
